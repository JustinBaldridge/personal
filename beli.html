                    <h2>Leadership</h2>

                    <p>Leadership is a very important thing in groups, but not to use their
                    powers against their team members. A group enviroment is not cause for
                    overpowering another. It is all about working together, and accepting
                    your idea may not be the greatest. Leadership isn't about command or
                    control, fear or force, demand or denial. It's about respect and responsibility.</p>

                    <h2>Teamwork</h2>
                
                    <p>Setting up teams are a effective way to accomplish goals. However, the
                    only way teams can reach it's full potential for greatness, is if everyone
                    is doing what they are supposed to be doing to help the team. Otherwise, even
                    one person slacking off could cause a lot of unnecessary stress on the others.</p>
                
                    <p>It also takes an open mind. There is a very, very low chance of a group 
                    unanimously agreeing on many things. So each of the present people there will
                    to be able to have a rational discussion about different ideas instead of
                    simply ignoring it.</p>
